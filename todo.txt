TODO LIST

 Admin
--------

- need a nice name for this project
- project website
- write up a really good README.md

 Questions & Ponderings
------------------------

- UBER IMPORTANT: implement 64-bit exception table vectors for IRQ & FIRQ at a minimum
    ; Set fake_vsync_isr=1 in config.txt and I will trigger the SMI interrupt (48) from my vsync callback.
    ; In your ISR, you should write 0 to SMICS (0x7E600000/0x20600000) to clear it.

 IMPORTANT NOTES
-----------------

- I set force_turbo=1 in config.txt so the core clock runs at 400Mhz
- The ARM_TIMER_CTL is currently configured assuming 250Mhz clock, so the counts are now double what they were
- Monitor the CPU thermal levels because now it's running at full bore

 Tasks
-------

- PERF: frame rate drops as the number of rendered lines increased on the console.
        NOTE 1: inlining of draw_string didn't seem to help much
        NOTE 2: use DMA?

- str_isprt: not using the stack, stomping w20

- command_find: add errors to a small buffer for output in terminal

 Done
------
- make draw_string support transparency
- write a draw_tile function -- basically draw_stamp but adjusted for background
- write a clear_buffer function to fill video memory with a byte
- create a caret data structure & draw function
    1. draw_hline function
    2. draw_vline function
- create sprite control "ram"
    dup (128)
        - dw ypos
        - dw xpos
        - dw tile
        - dw palette
        - dw flags
        - dw userpointer
- create background control "ram"
- create an "I/O" area in ram
    - joy1  dw
    - joy2  dw
    - sound control RAM 256 bytes ---> core1 processor loop
- create palette control "ram"
    1. almost done?
- uart_init function
- uart_getc function
- uart_putc function
- uart_putstr function
- FIX: joy_read is probably clocking the controller way too fast. Use ARM_TIMER for better control.
- FIX: check parameter length in command_buffer against 0 to prevent underflow
- FIX: cmd_dump_mem_func is dumping extra ASCII on remainder
       fix ASCII offset for remainer lines
- FIX: string_number converts lowercase a-z to uppercase
- command: fps
- XXX: review timer.s because i refactored timer_update and it should be tested again
- command: load
- command: unload
- command: info
    - return game title, author, verison, revision information
- command: run
- command: stop
- command_find: renumber & save all state
- params array should be an array of small structures that has type and word value combined
